Long session but made steady progress. Took the SDD updates in stride, then got pulled into normalization. The hash-separator heading fix was straightforward once I added the escape hatch. The escaped double-underscore bug was trickierâ€”needed to guard the regex replacements so backslash-escaped sequences survive. Added synthetic fixtures to reproduce the lesson-plan issues; shrinking the set down to three target regressions feels much cleaner. The math-subscript case ended up fixed as a side effect of the escape-aware tweaks. Tests now green across the regression fixtures. Good coverage, good stopping point.
